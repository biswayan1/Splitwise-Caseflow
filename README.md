# Splitwise Cashflow
Splitwise Cashflow Project

It will be used for people to handle their finances and keep track of their transactions with their friends. In this project I have implemented heap data structure in JavaScript to minimise the splitwise cashflow between different persons.

We won't have to worry about all the transactions between everyone we'll just have to track the final cashflow. It's a minimization method using heaps concept.
